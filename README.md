# Hardware Monitor

This is our school project for our team. 

This program was made with the purpose of monitoring and measuring the PC resources and afterwards displaying in a friendly manner the results as follows: CPU Component, CPU cores + temperature, CPU package + temperature, CPU load (measurement of the computational work the system is performing), load memory, GPU component, load GPU, disk component, load used space. There are two parts: components (CPU, disk, motherboard, GPU) and sensors (temperature, speed of load, fan). Our program measures the components and sensors for a Windows Operating System
